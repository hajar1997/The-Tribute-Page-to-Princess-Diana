            <p id="intro-text">Princess Diana was the mother of HRH Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and HRH Prince Harry. She tragically lost her life in a car crash in Paris in 1997, at age 36. Diana didn’t just accept the world around her for the way it was and she
                used her role in the public eye to help causes that many others overlooked. She also believed in the power of young people to change the world and that young people should be supported to make sure they reach their full potential.</p>

                <p class="diana-text">Her passion led her to become involved in helping a number of charities such as the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, advocating the rights of the homeless, supporting the disabled and ill children through Great Ormond Street Hospital,
                    breaking down the stigma of the HIV/AIDS virus and many more. </p>
